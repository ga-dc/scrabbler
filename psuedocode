create class for ScrabbleWord
using getters so have attr_accessor
initialize ScrabbleWord
include word in argument

define word and set it as a method

set a getter = get_word
lowercase = downcase


to get score:
give score a value of zero
list of letters and their values
use downcase to get lower case of letters
split the word to get value of each letter
interpolation (In cases like the above, you either need to convert the variable to a string using .to_s OR use something called "interpolation.)
score will equal the letter * it's value


if a multiplier, map double and triple paths
mulitply by the score value
get total score


test a new variable
